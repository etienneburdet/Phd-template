Phd-template
============

My phd thesis template, based on the memoir class.

- memoir.tex is for a full compile of the document.
- SingleCompile.tex is for a proof reading version of a single chapter.

Other things can be figured out easily. Requires Xetex/lualatex.


### Participation
Feel free to fork and pull request, I'll be happy to integrate your enhancements (and credit you of course !)

### To do
- memoir.tex : the part decoration command is still messy, it could be much cleaner.
- SingleCompile.tex : deal with \gls commands, workaround for section with multiple titles (\section[toc][header]{full title})
- Writing some very (very) short documentation/workflow.
