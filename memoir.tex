%%%%%%%%%%%% Practical Use %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
% This template is to be compiled with XeLatex or LuaLatex and Bibtex.
%
% Microtype package capabilities will vary depending on the compiliation method (lualatex or Xelatex).
%
% I strongly recommend to name your chapters rather than numbering them. Numbering can vary with non-numbered chapter such as intro or conclusion. Latex auto-numbers anyways, let him do his job !
%
% It is recommanded to use xindy (external software) for the glossaries:
% - (Install xindy)
% - Fully Compile (e.g. XeLaTeX -> XeLaTeX)
% - In a terminal in your current working directory type : "xindy memoir.tex". This will create the appropriate files.
% - Recompile, your keys are listed.
